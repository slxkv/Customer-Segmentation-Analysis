## Project Background

The company that I worked with here is a company that operates in the global logistics and transportation industry, specializing in the sale and shipment of various vehicles, including cars, ships, and motorcycles. It has been in business for over a decade, steadily establishing itsleves as a reliable partner for both individual consumers and businesses seeking to transport goods across international borders.

Marketing department wants to know more about the customer base by segmenting them according to their purchasing behavior. They want to tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and increase sales by focusing on high-value customers and re-engaging less active ones.

### Key pain point?
- Lack of targeted marketing: Without clear segmentation, marketing efforts are often broad and less effective, leading to missed opportunities for personalized customer engagement.
- Customer churn: Difficulty in identifying at-risk customers who are likely to stop purchasing, resulting in higher churn rates.
  
### Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Scores: These scores allow us to classify customers based on their purchasing behavior, helping to identify segments for targeted marketing.
